adjust the settings for your event, then check the &#8216;substitute&#8217; toggle.
Toggling this option on will display a list of event[s] which match the criteria

those events and split the selected event[s] for you ( if the selected event[s]
extend beyond the new event you are creating ).</p>

<dd>These details are populated from the event you clicked.</dd>

<dd>This is the event you want to swap with. There are 2 filters provided to help
you find the event you are looking to swap with.  Currently, you are able to
swap with events of varying types ( so go ahead and swap your primary on call
shift with a teammate&#8217;s vacation ), though we may restrict this in the future.</dd>

<div class="section" id="teams-schedules">
<h2>Teams Schedules<a class="headerlink" href="#teams-schedules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The schedules page is used to manage the templates which the scheduler uses to
generate the events you see on the calendar ( outside of custom events ).</p>
<p>Currently the scheduler runs every hour and will generate schedules 3 weeks out,
by default. Auto-scheduler preferences from the old version of Oncall have been
preserved as well. Thus, if a team chose to populate N weeks into the future in
the old Oncall, the new oncall will also populate N weeks into the future,
unless a new schedule has been created. This setting will become configurable in
an upcoming release.</p>
<p>Currently, the scheduler prioritizes users who haven&#8217;t been on-call for the
longest period of time. It respects conflicting events on the team&#8217;s calendar as
well (e.g. it will not schedule someone to be on-call if that user has a
vacation marked). The scheduler chooses its start date based on the last event
that it scheduled. This may create confusing behavior if users manually delete a
scheduled event and replace it with a new one. In this case, the scheduler will
double-up shifts, believing a hole in the schedule has been created. This
behavior was created in response to the previous scheduler&#8217;s behavior, which
began starting at the last event on the calendar and tended to create holes in
the schedule. In an upcoming release, the scheduler&#8217;s start time will become
user-configurable, allowing users to decide the exact date that the scheduler
beings to populate events.</p>
<p>It prioritizes users that haven&#8217;t been on call the longest. These settings will
become configurable in an upcoming release.</p>

<div class="section" id="settings-notifications">
<h3>Settings Notifications<a class="headerlink" href="#settings-notifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Notification settings are used to manage the notifications you receive for items
related to your Oncall calendars through emails, text, or phone calls. Reminder
and notification creation uses natural language to help create the exact
settings you require to make sure your on call is working as intended; a more
detailed list of options is available below. There are 2 types of settings you
can manage under this page : reminders and notifications.</p>
<div class="section" id="reminders">
<h4>Reminders<a class="headerlink" href="#reminders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Reminders are time-based alerts you can receive for the start and end of your
shifts. By default, you will have 2 reminders - 1 week before and 1 day before
the start of all your shifts except for vacation. You can add new reminders by
clicking the new reminder button, and delete by going to edit → delete.</p>
<p>The modal for adding reminnder has the following options:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Mode</dt>
<dd>How you would like to receive your alert. Only Email, Call, SMS are available.
Slack support will be added in the future.</dd>
<dt>Duration</dt>
<dd>How long before your shift[s] start/end you would like to receive your alert.</dd>
<dt>Roles</dt>
<dd>Select the role[s] for which you would like to receive that alert.</dd>
<dt>Type</dt>
<dd>Currently supports &#8216;starts&#8217; and &#8216;ends&#8217;, meaning you can receive alerts before
you&#8217;re going oncall, and before you&#8217;re going offcall.</dd>
<dt>Team</dt>
<dd>Team for which you would like to receive the alert. Currently, you must create
a separate reminder for each team you want to receive the alert for ( even if
the reminder settings for all teams you are a part of will be identical ).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notifications">
<h4>Notifications<a class="headerlink" href="#notifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Notifications are event-based designed around events you might be interested in
knowing about. The notifications will be sent <strong>immediately</strong> when the selected
<strong>event</strong> occurs for any shift that belongs to you. See &#8216;event&#8217; below for a more
detailed explanation.</p>
<p>The modal for adding notification has the following options:</p>
